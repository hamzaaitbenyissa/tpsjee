# Dependency injection framework in java 
The Dependency Injection pattern involves 3 types of classes.

#Client Class1Ô∏è‚É£
It is a class which depends on the service class.
#Service Class 2Ô∏è‚É£
It is a class that provides service to the client class.
# Injector Class 3Ô∏è‚É£ 
It injects the service class object into the client class.

## go to app and run the main class 
## try to test it with other examples üòé
